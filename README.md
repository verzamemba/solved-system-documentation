“System Documentation” Please respond to the following:

<ul>

 <li>Ray and Jason have just finished developing the documentation for a system your team recently completed. Ray insists that the documentation should be printed in booklet format and included with the system. Jason insists that paper manuals are outdated and that the documentation should only be distributed electronically via DVD. Compare and contrast the use of online documentation and paper documentation. Then, make a decision about what documentation you will provide with your system and explain it to Ray and Jason.</li>

 <li>Debate whether or not to give credit to authors and designers of training manuals. Support your argument.</li>
